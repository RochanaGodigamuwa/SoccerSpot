            <h3>The Sport</h3>
            <p>Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team's goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins.</p>
            <p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, "folk football" games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. But before the sport became famous in 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, well it was done by the universities students.The development of modern football was closely tied to processes of industrialization and urbanization in Victorian Britain. This is how the sport started.</p>
