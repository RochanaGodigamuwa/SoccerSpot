                            He burst onto the scene in the 1958 World Cup as a 17-year old and was crucial in his
                            country's first World Cup victory.
                            Pele was named the best performer at the 1970 World Cup, and two more titles came along
                            in
                            1962 and 1970.
                            Not to mention that the 1970 World Cup champions are regarded as the top international
                            football squad.

                            Maradona was an example of a rebel, famous for his explosive temper but also revered
                            by many for his extraordinary ability. He had the ability to outdribble opponents like

                            that would confound defenses, and he could consistently create magical moments.

                            The Netherlands' ascent to football aristocracy was sparked by Cruyff, an Amsterdam

                            in the penalty area, and finishing.
                            Despite the numerous controversies that dogged his tenure, it was clear that the fans
                            enjoyed his game.
