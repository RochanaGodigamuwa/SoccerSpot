                <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Each team consist of 11 players.Football is played in accordance with a set of rules, known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a single round ball (the football) and two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal, thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then the game is a draw. There are exceptions to this rule, however; see Duration and tie-breaking methods below.</p>
                <p>The primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their hands or arms during play (though they do use their hands during a throw-in restart). Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their hands or arms.In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is limited. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the referee. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.</p>
                <p>Football dates back to the early 18's. Games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in many countries throughout history. According to FIFA, the "very earliest form of the game for which there is scientific evidence was an exercise of precisely this skilful technique dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. in China." <br><br><a href="./jayathuExtra" style="color: rgb(0, 89, 255); text-decoration: none;" >...Read more</a></p>

        </div>
        <div class="history">
            <div class="leftCol">
                <p>The rules of football as they are codified today are effectively based on the mid-19th-century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played at the public schools of England. The first ever set of football rules were written at Eton College in 1815. The Cambridge Rules were a code of football rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, which have influenced the development of Association football (also known simply as "football", or soccer)</p><br><br>
                <p>There are seventeen laws in the official Laws of the Game. The same Laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors or women are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. The laws can be found on the official FIFA website.<br><br><a href="./minolExtra" style="color: rgb(0, 89, 255); text-decoration: none;" >...Read more</a></p>

                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>The game is split into two teams. Each team has 11 players(excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner </p>
                    <h3>Playing Area</h3>
                    <p>The Football pitch is rectangular shaped ground in which at the ends, both ends they is a goal(Boxed net).(<em>See Left Image</em>)</p>
                    <h3>Begining Of the Play</h3>
                    <p>For the first time when starting the game the forwarder or anyone taking the ball must go to the center of the circle shaped area and from they he must pass the ball to the his side in which then the game starts. And same like that when a team scores. The opposition side gets to start the game from the middle as when starting the game</p>
